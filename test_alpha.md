#Guides to preparing stuff

Posters are a good tool to present ones research in a visual fashion. As such it is quite differnt from a written document, e.g. a journal article. To begin with, there is a good 2-page article on poster preparation here: 10 simple rules for creating a good poster presentation [[Erren et al. 2007]].

Here are two good articles outlining 10 important rules to follow for a good grant application and oral presentation [[Bourne and Chalupa 2006],[Bourne 2007]].
